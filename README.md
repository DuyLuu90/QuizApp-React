# Trivia game with React

We love to learn and have fun and what better way to do that than to play a round of trivia. 

This client-side application using the popular JavaScript library, React. For more information about React, please visit https://reactjs.org/

## Technology:

* React
* HTML5, JavaScript, CSS3

## Key Terms:

* **React**: Expressions, props, defaultProps,callback props, composition, state, React life-cycle(such as render, componentDidMount, componentDidUpdate), event listeners, bind, conditional rendering, React Router(Prompt,Link, Switch,Route), controlled component
* **Test**: smoke test, snapshot test, unit testing, integration testing 
* **Algorithm**: Array, Hash Map, Stack(push method)
* **Best practices**: DRY(Don't Repeat Yourself), SOC(Separation of Concerns)
* **Others**: setInterval, conditional ternary operator, JSON parser, loops, obj destructuring, Dev Tools(Lighthouse)

## Instructions:

* A round of trivia has 10 questions
* All questions are multiple-choice questions 
* User has to submit the answer in order to move to the next question.

If you're ready, let [PLAY](https://quiz-app-react-three.vercel.app/) now!

## App features:

* All questions and options are randomly ordered. It's very unlikely that 2 players work on the same set of questions at the same time. 
* After a user has submitted his/her answer, the correct answer will be revealed, and his/her score will be updated.
* A clock is provided for the user to keep track of his/her time.
* While taking the quiz, if users navigate away or close the browser tab, they will be prompted to confirm if they really want to leave.
* At the end of the round, user will see his/her final score, and how long it took for him/her to complete the quiz. He/she will then be asked to retake the quiz, or exit (go back to the home page)

## Future development:

* Players will be able to register and log in to their accounts, and have their scores recorded. 
* Registered users can submit their own questions. Admins will then decide if those questions can be added to the Quiz Bank or not.

Note: we will need a full-stack app (front-end,back-end) for these features.
